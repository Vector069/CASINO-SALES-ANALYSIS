**Casino Sales Analysis Dashboard**

**About the Project**

This project is a Sales Analysis Dashboard for a casino, which I developed using Microsoft Excel. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the casino’s overall performance across different months and identify key insights such as betting patterns, profit margins, and customer behavior.
One of the main goals of this dashboard was to help the business track financial outcomes and better understand customer engagement. It gives a clear picture of how different days and months contribute to overall performance and highlights opportunities for strategic decision-making.

**Tool Used**

•	Microsoft Excel: I used Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and creating the entire dashboard.

**Problem Solved**

Before this analysis, there was no clear understanding of when the casino experienced peak customer activity or which periods were truly profitable. Stakeholders lacked visibility into:

•	Which days customers were most active
•	Which months brought in high revenue but low profit
•	The effectiveness of bonuses and their impact on profit

By building this dashboard, I was able to solve that problem by:

•	Identifying Wednesday as the most active day, revealing the best time to introduce campaigns or customer engagement strategies
•	Exposing July as a high-revenue but low-profit month, showing that large payouts and bonuses can negatively affect profitability even with high stakes
•	Highlighting midweek-to-weekend trends that can help the business plan targeted promotions to drive more consistent activity
This analysis helped the casino better align marketing efforts, optimize bonuses, and understand how daily and monthly trends affect profit.

**Insights from the Dashboard**

**1. Monthly Performance Overview**

•	The total amount staked by customers during the period analyzed was $20.74 million, while the total customer winnings reached $19.89 million.
•	The most profitable month was August, with a profit of $368,560, followed closely by September at $333,181.
•	July recorded the highest stakes ($8.94 million) and the highest customer winnings ($5.94 million), but it had the lowest profit ($109,926), likely due to higher payouts and bonuses.
•	The total profit across the three months analyzed was $811,667.

**2. Customer Behavior**

•	In terms of customer activity, Wednesdays had the highest average engagement at $480, followed by Thursdays and Saturdays.
•	Mondays and Tuesdays were the least active, averaging below $260 in daily engagement. This shows a mid-to-late-week spike in user activity.

**3. Weekly Betting Trends**

•	Fridays recorded the highest number of weekly bets (62,908), followed by Thursday and Wednesday.
•	Sunday and Monday had the lowest number of weekly bets, each below 50,000.
•	These trends suggest that customers are more active from midweek toward the weekend.

**Recommendations for the Casino**

Based on the insights from this analysis, here are a few key recommendations the casino can implement:

•	Leverage peak days (Wednesdays to Fridays) for promotions, tournaments, or bonus campaigns, as these are the most active betting days.
•	Review bonus strategies in high-stake months like July to ensure profitability isn't undermined by excessive payouts or promotions.
•	Target low-activity days (Mondays and Tuesdays) with engagement strategies such as cashback offers or exclusive weekday deals to drive traffic on slow days.
•	Monitor player winnings closely to ensure a healthy balance between customer satisfaction and house profit.
•	Consider using this insight to inform budgeting, staffing, and resource allocation, especially around high-traffic periods.

**Final Thoughts**

This project shows how Excel can be used to extract valuable insights from business data. With just a spreadsheet, I was able to analyze, visualize, and interpret performance trends in a way that supports strategic planning and operational improvements in a casino setting.
